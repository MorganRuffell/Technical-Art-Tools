VEX Notes:

## Keywords

VEX			Compiled to C/C++ code, not alternative to scripting but a more efficent language designed to create shaders and create nodes

HScript			Legacy scripting tools, similar to MEL inside Maya

Python			More modern scripting language, this is used inside pretty much everything nowadays. With companies looking to centrailize resources
				and employees wanting access to resources easier than before.


## Introduction

VEX is Houdinis scripting language, like all things in houdini. It takes everything you've known and shoots steroids inside of it.
The language is similar to C++ in that issues are critical. If you fuck up the language, then that's it the program ends. There is little to no exception
catching.

The syntax is primarily C like, so as we know C this will be arguably easier to work with.

Before we even write a line of code, it's important that we understand what is going on with houdini when we start programming with it:

	HOM		Houdini Object Model, this is similar to the DirectX12 component object model that we are currently working with inside of Creative

	HScript		Your grandads scripting language inside Houdini, this used to be the main one that we used. Now we use python.

	VEX		Coding tool inside Houdini which is compiled to C/C++ code, it draws elements from pixars renderman.

	HAPI		Allows Houdini digital assets to be used directly inside of a host application, so for example we could yeet our stuff from houdini to Unreal
			There are two wrappers to this C and Python. We'll work in python, as we are more concerned with scripting as of now. But we can go to C++
			later down the line.

	PDG		This is for dependency graphs inside of Houdini, there is also a python API for jobs scripts.
	
	HQueue		We can remotely control HQueue servers, this is really advanced and way outside the scope of what I'm doing with technical art tools
	
	HDK		Houdini Development kit, all in C++ this is for developing more components for houdini. We are not going to touch this either!	


As you can see houdini has a massive range of APIs for writing extensions, code and all round technical stuff you can really dig into.
I'd really reccommend that you have a good understanding of houdini and it's DCC workflows before writing code in it.

## Content

Vex has four categories of content.

	-	Geometry
	-	Shader
	-	Particles
	-	Fur

VEX brings together C which it is loosely based on, as well as borrowing things from C++ and Renderman.
As well as having four categories of content, it is used in several places.
