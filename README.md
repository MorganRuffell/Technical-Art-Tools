### Project Information
Technical Art tools is a selection of tools made for Autodesk Products, Unreal Engine (My Favourite thing at the moment!) and other DCC packages, including Houdini.
They are all under construction and are a little something I'm doing on weekends outside of my Final Project for university. They are freely accessible and open to all!


### MEL:
  
    -     Toolkit for a marking menu that can open applications on your system from inside maya
    -     Commands to fetch data about the maya install
    -     Orientate IK - Orientates IK handles on character rigs
    -     Zero Transforms - Simple goes through Zeros transforms on all selected nodes in maya
    -     Attribute Saver - Simply Saves attributes on a selected character rig, allowing them to be stored and then retrived for later use
    -     WIP - Allows you to open applications from within maya, still something I'm working on. Objective would be to allow integration with perforce 
          saving artists from having to work with p4 helix or p4 cmds.

### Python:

    -     Animation tweener, uses object orientated python code to interpolate new positions for animations.


### MaxScript:

    -     Under Construction
    
### Unreal Engine:

    -     Asset Renamer - Just renames stuff when executed in editor, comes with a WIP GUI based on PySide
    -     Power of Two - Checks texture nature to ensure that they can be correctly mapped
    -     Prefixer - Appends a list of prefixes to selected assets in the editor, this is stored as a json file in this repo and imported
    -     Asset Duplicator - Simply Duplicates assets in Unreal's Content Browser
   
### Houdini :

    -     Under Construction
   
   
##### External Dependencies:
Included in this library are some external dependencies, these files are listed as and when they are used

     -    Qt.py from https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py, this is not mine and I do not claim credit over this file or any
          other contents of that repository, it is included as an external dependency for technical art tools.
